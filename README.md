# explore-weather-trends
To explore the weather trends used excel by finding the moving averages
The goal of the project is to analyze the global temperature and the local temperature and compare the temperature trends between the both.
 I have used the SQL for extracting the data and MS EXCEL to analyze and compare both the data using a line chart.
